# TweetDeck

A simple TweetDeck implementation, with comment sections, search, persisted state, drag-n-drop and automatic horizontal scroll.

Current limitations:
* Drag-n-drop is a bit buggy (I used an external react library)
* No unit tests (I tried to save time, I think I was already too late with delivering the task)

## How to run

Note: before running the app, you may want to use the 'REACT_DEVTOOLS' and 'REDUX_DEVTOOLS'. If so, please, uncomment the line 18 in `store.js`.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve on localhost:3000
npm start
```

Extra: if you are a fan of "How I met your mother" series - I left an Easter Egg 4 you :)
